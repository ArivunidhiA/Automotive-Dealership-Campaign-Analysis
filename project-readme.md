## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automotive-dealership-analytics.git
cd automotive-dealership-analytics
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up data:
   - Place your sales data CSV files in the `data/` directory
   - Use the data documentation in `data/README.md` for format requirements

### Running the Analysis

1. Start with the notebooks in sequential order:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/
```

2. Run the automated analysis:
```bash
python src/main.py
```

## 📈 Analysis Components

### 1. Data Processing (`src/data_processing.py`)
- Data cleaning and standardization
- Feature engineering
- Customer metrics calculation

### 2. Campaign Analysis (`src/campaign_analysis.py`)
- Campaign performance metrics
- ROI calculation
- Response rate analysis

### 3. Customer Segmentation (`src/customer_segmentation.py`)
- RFM analysis
- Customer lifetime value calculation
- Behavioral segmentation

### 4. Predictive Modeling (`src/predictive_models.py`)
- Response prediction
- Customer churn analysis
- Campaign optimization

## 📊 Sample Visualizations

The project generates various visualizations including:
- Customer segment distribution
- Campaign performance heatmaps
- ROI analysis charts
- Response prediction accuracy metrics

## 📝 Usage Examples

```python
# Load and process data
from src.data_processing import DataProcessor

processor = DataProcessor('data/')
sales_data = processor.load_sales_data()
customer_metrics = processor.calculate_customer_metrics(sales_data)

# Analyze campaigns
from src.campaign_analysis import CampaignAnalyzer

analyzer = CampaignAnalyzer()
campaign_metrics = analyzer.calculate_campaign_metrics(sales_data)

# Train predictive model
from src.predictive_models import PredictiveModel

model = PredictiveModel()
X, y = model.prepare_features(customer_metrics)
results = model.train_model(X, y)
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
pytest tests/
```

## 📋 Data Requirements

The project expects the following data files in CSV format:
- `sales_data.csv`: Customer transaction records
- `campaign_data.csv`: Marketing campaign details
- `customer_data.csv`: Customer demographic information

See `data/README.md` for detailed file specifications.

## 📈 Results and Insights

The analysis provides insights into:
- High-value customer identification
- Most effective campaign types
- Optimal campaign timing
- Customer response patterns
- Revenue optimization opportunities
